Hi, I'm David — a creative technologist with over 30 years of experience in IT, blending a deep technical background with a lifelong passion for design and the arts.

My journey started in the 1990s working with mainframe computers for banks in central London, evolving into IT support and consultancy for VIP clients. Throughout that time, I've always had one foot in the creative world — music production with synthesisers, drum machines and keys; design, photography, art and fashion.

In recent years I've moved deeper into the creative software space, working with tools like Adobe, Blender and HeyGen, and embracing AI as a tool for accelerating ideas and removing the mundane — much like the internet changed everything in the mid-90s.

Today I'm at an exciting crossroads, combining IT consulting with creative production to offer a broad range of solutions across both tech and design.
